        <p class="animal-digest">An elephant's trunk is an amazing thing. The trunk has over 40,000 muscles and is used to smell, grab food and other objects, lift, drink, dig, and balance. Finger-like appendages at the tip of the trunk are able to pick up very small objects like twigs.</p>

        <p class="animal-description">They are the largest land mammal alive today. The genus consists of two extant species: the African bush elephant, L. africana, and the smaller African forest elephant, L. cyclotis. African elephants are found widely in Sub-Saharan Africa, in dense forests, mopane and miombo woodlands, Sahelian scrub, or deserts. These animals are herbivores and eat over three hundred pounds of food daily.</p>
